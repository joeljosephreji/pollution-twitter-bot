The corresponding twitter auth data should be put in auth_info.json in the project root with the corresponding names (found in server.py) for the values.
The template for the auth_info.json can be found in the project root as auth_info.json.example.
Also, this project requires a lot of refactoring to be done, it was a semester project done for a particular course and is relatively crude.
The sensor used in this project is the ESP sensor so do check that docs as well.
